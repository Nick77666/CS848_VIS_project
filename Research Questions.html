  <!-- RQ1 -->
  <h3>RQ1: Can we identify key influential authors based on the number of connections they have?</h3>

  <p>Top authors with the most connections.</p>
  <!-- RQ2 -->
  <h3>RQ2: Are there specific groups or clusters of authors who frequently collaborate with each other?</h3>
  <img src="chart2.PNG" alt="Chart 2" width="500">
  <p>Each bar represents a distinct collaboration cluster, and the height of the bar represents the number of authors in that cluster. This visualization helps us understand the distribution of authors across the different collaboration clusters. It shows that some clusters have more authors (and hence more collaborations) than others.</p>
